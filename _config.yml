      We introduce the first large-scale corpus for long-form question
      answering, a task requiring elaborate and in-depth answers to
      open-ended questions. The dataset comprises 270K threads from
      the Reddit forum ``Explain Like I'm Five'' (ELI5) where an
      online community provides answers to questions which are
      comprehensible by five year olds.  Compared to existing
      datasets, ELI5 comprises diverse questions requiring
      multi-sentence answers. We provide a large set of web documents
      to help answer the question. % in order to find support for the
      answer. Automatic and human evaluations show that an abstractive
      model trained with a multi-task objective outperforms
      conventional Seq2Seq, language modeling, as well as a strong
      extractive baseline.  However, our best model is still far from
      human performance since raters prefer gold responses in over
      86\% of cases, leaving ample opportunity for future improvement.

      We explore unsupervised pre-training for speech recognition by
      learning representations of raw audio. wav2vec is trained on
      large amounts of unlabeled audio data and the resulting
      representations are then used to improve acoustic model
      training. We pre-train a simple multi-layer convolutional neural
      network optimized via a noise contrastive binary classification
      task. Our experiments on WSJ reduce WER of a strong
      character-based log-mel filterbank baseline by up to 32% when
      only a few hours of transcribed data is available. Our approach
      achieves 2.43% WER on the nov92 test set. This outperforms Deep
      Speech 2, the best reported character-based system in the
      literature while using three orders of magnitude less labeled
      training data.

      Pre-trained language model representations have been
      successful in a wide range of language understanding tasks.
      In this paper, we examine different strategies to integrate
      pretrained representations into sequence to sequence models
      and apply it to neural machine translation and abstractive
      summarization. We find that pre-trained representations are
      most effective when added to the encoder network which slows
      inference by only 14%. Our experiments in machine translation
      show gains of up to 5.3 BLEU in a simulated resource-poor setup.
      While returns diminish with more labeled data, we still
      observe improvements when millions of sentence-pairs are
      available. Finally, on abstractive summarization we achieve
      a new state of the art on the full text version of
      CNN-DailyMail.

      We present a new approach for pretraining a bi-directional
      transformer model that provides significant performance
      gains across a variety of language understanding problems.
      Our model solves a cloze-style word reconstruction task,
      where each word is ablated and must be predicted given the
      rest of the text. Experiments demonstrate large performance
      gains on GLUE and new state of the art results on NER as
      well as constituency parsing benchmarks, consistent with
      the concurrently introduced BERT model. We also present a
      detailed analysis of a number of factors that contribute
      to effective pretraining, including data domain and size,
      model capacity, and variations on the cloze objective.

    abstract: >
      Mixture models trained via EM are among the simplest, most
      widely used and well understood latent variable models in the
      machine learning literature. Surprisingly, these models have
      been hardly explored in text generation applications such as
      machine translation. In principle, they provide a latent
      variable to control generation and produce a diverse set of
      hypotheses. In practice, however, mixture models are prone to
      degeneracies---often only one component gets trained or the
      latent variable is simply ignored. We find that disabling
      dropout noise in responsibility computation is critical to
      successful training. In addition, the design choices of
      parameterization, prior distribution, hard versus soft EM and
      online versus offline assignment can dramatically affect model
      performance. We develop an evaluation protocol to assess both
      quality and diversity of generations against multiple
      references, and provide an extensive empirical study of several
      mixture model variants. Our analysis shows that certain types of
      mixture models are more robust and offer the best trade-off
      between translation quality and diversity compared to
      variational models and diverse decoding approaches.

    abstract: >
      Previous work on predicting or generating 3D human pose
      sequences regresses either joint rotations or joint positions.
      The former strategy is prone to error accumulation along
      the kinematic chain, as well as discontinuities when using
      Euler angles or exponential maps as parameterizations.
      The latter requires re-projection onto skeleton constraints
      to avoid bone stretching and invalid configurations.
      This work addresses both limitations. QuaterNet represents
      rotations with quaternions and our loss function performs
      forward kinematics on a skeleton to penalize absolute
      position errors instead of angle errors.
      We investigate both recurrent and convolutional architectures
      and evaluate on short-term prediction and long-term generation.
      For the latter, our approach is qualitatively judged as
      realistic as recent neural strategies from the graphics
      literature.
      Our experiments compare quaternions to Euler angles
      as well as exponential maps and show that only a
      very short context is required to make reliable future
      predictions.
      Finally, we show that the standard evaluation protocol
      for Human3. 6M produces high variance results and
      we propose a simple solution.

    abstract: >
      Self-attention is a useful mechanism to build generative models
      for language and images.
      It determines the importance of context elements by comparing
      each element to the current time step. In this paper, we show
      that a very lightweight convolution can perform competitively
      to the best reported self-attention results.
      Next, we introduce dynamic convolutions which are simpler and
      more efficient than self-attention.
      We predict separate convolution kernels based solely on the
      current time-step in order to determine the importance of
      context elements.
      The number of operations required by this approach scales
      linearly in the input length, whereas self-attention is quadratic.
      Experiments on large-scale machine translation,
      language modeling and abstractive summarization show that
      dynamic convolutions improve over strong self-attention models.
      On the WMT'14 English-German test set dynamic convolutions
      achieve a new state of the art of 29.7 BLEU.

      In open-domain dialogue intelligent agents should exhibit
      the use of knowledge, however there are few convincing demonstrations
      of this to date.
      The most popular sequence to sequence models typically" generate
      and hope" generic utterances that can be memorized in the weights
      of the model when mapping from input utterance (s) to output,
      rather than employing recalled knowledge as context.
      Use of knowledge has so far proved difficult, in part because
      of the lack of a supervised learning benchmark task which exhibits
      knowledgeable open dialogue with clear grounding.
      To that end we collect and release a large dataset with conversations
      directly grounded with knowledge retrieved from Wikipedia.
      We then design architectures capable of retrieving knowledge,
      reading and conditioning on it, and finally generating natural
      responses.
      Our best performing dialogue models are able to conduct
      knowledgeable discussions on open-domain topics as evaluated
      by automatic metrics and human evaluations, while our
      new benchmark allows for measuring further improvements
      in this important research direction.

      We introduce adaptive input representations for neural language
      modeling which extend the adaptive softmax of

      There are several choices on how to factorize the input and
      output layers, and whether to model words, characters or
      sub-word units.
      We perform a systematic comparison of popular choices for
      a self-attentional architecture. Our experiments show that
      models equipped with adaptive embeddings are more than
      twice as fast to train than the popular character input CNN
      while having a lower number of parameters.
      We achieve a new state of the art on the WikiText-103
      benchmark of 20.51 perplexity, improving the next best
      known result by 8.7 perplexity. On the Billion word benchmark,
      we achieve a state of the art of 24.14 perplexity.

      In this work, we demonstrate that 3D poses in video can
      be effectively estimated with a fully convolutional model
      based on dilated temporal convolutions over 2D keypoints.
      We also introduce back-projection, a simple and effective
      semi-supervised training method that leverages unlabeled
      video data.
      We start with predicted 2D keypoints for unlabeled video,
      then estimate 3D poses and finally back-project to
      the input 2D keypoints.
      In the supervised setting, our fully-convolutional model
      outperforms the previous best result from the literature
      by 6 mm mean per-joint position error on Human3. 6M,
      corresponding to an error reduction of 11%, and the model
      also shows significant improvements on HumanEva-I.
      Moreover, experiments with back-projection show that it
      comfortably outperforms previous state-of-the-art results
      in semi-supervised settings where labeled data is scarce.
      Code and models are available.

      An effective method to improve neural machine translation
      with monolingual data is to augment the parallel training
      corpus with back-translations of target language sentences.
      This work broadens the understanding of back-translation
      and investigates a number of methods to generate synthetic
      source sentences. We find that in all but resource poor
      settings back-translations obtained via sampling or noised
      beam outputs are most effective. Our analysis shows that
      sampling or noisy synthetic data gives a much stronger
      training signal than data generated by beam or greedy search.
      We also compare how synthetic data compares to genuine bitext
      and study various domain effects. Finally, we scale to
      hundreds of millions of monolingual sentences and achieve
      a new state of the art of 35 BLEU on the
      WMT'14 English-German test set.

      Sequence to sequence learning models still require several days

      a single 8-GPU machine with careful tuning and implementation.
      On WMT'14 English-German translation, we match the accuracy

      on 8 GPUs and we obtain a new state of the art of 29.3 BLEU

      Deep learning for predicting or generating 3D human pose sequences
      is an active research area. Previous work regresses either joint
      rotations or joint positions. The former strategy is prone to error
      accumulation along the kinematic chain, as well as discontinuities
      when using Euler angle or exponential map parameterizations.
      The latter requires re-projection onto skeleton constraints to avoid
      bone stretching and invalid configurations. This work addresses both
      limitations. Our recurrent network, QuaterNet, represents rotations
      with quaternions and our loss function performs forward kinematics
      on a skeleton to penalize absolute position errors instead of angle
      errors. On short-term predictions, QuaterNet improves the
      state-of-the-art quantitatively. For long-term generation, our
      approach is qualitatively judged as realistic as recent neural
      strategies from the graphics literature.

      Machine translation is a popular test bed for research in neural
      sequence-to-sequence models but despite much recent research,
      there is still a lack of understanding of these models.
      Practitioners report performance degradation with large beams,
      the under-estimation of rare words and a lack of diversity
      in the final translations. Our study relates some of these issues
      to the inherent uncertainty of the task, due to the existence of
      multiple valid translations for a single source sentence, and
      to the extrinsic uncertainty caused by noisy training data.
      We propose tools and metrics to assess how uncertainty in the data
      is captured by the model distribution and how it affects search
      strategies that generate translations. Our results show that
      search works remarkably well but that the models tend to spread
      too much probability mass over the hypothesis space.
      Next, we propose tools to assess model calibration and show how
      to easily fix some shortcomings of current models. We release
      both code and multiple human reference translations for two
      popular benchmarks.

      Our model then generates a new sentence which reformulates
      the initial sentence by avoiding the words from the marked tokens.
      Our approach builds upon neural sequence-to-sequence modeling and
      introduces a neural network which takes as input a sentence along
      with deleted token markers. Our model is trained on translation
      bi-text by simulating post-edits. Our results on post-editing
      for machine translation and paraphrasing evaluate the performance
      of our approach. We show +11.4 BLEU with limited post-editing effort
      on the WMT-14 English-German translation task (25.2 to 36.6),
      which represents +5.9 BLEU over the post-editing baseline (30.7 to 36.6).

      The prevalent approach to sequence to sequence learning maps
      an input sequence to a variable length output sequence via
      recurrent neural networks. We introduce an architecture based
      entirely on convolutional neural networks. Compared to
      recurrent models, computations over all elements can be fully
      parallelized during training and optimization is easier since
      the number of non-linearities is fixed and independent of the
      input length. Our use of gated linear units eases gradient
      propagation and we equip each decoder layer with a separate
      attention module. We outperform the accuracy of the deep
      LSTM setup of Wu et al. (2016) on both WMT'14 English-German and
      WMT'14 English-French translation at an order of magnitude
      faster speed, both on GPU and CPU.

      The pre-dominant approach to language modeling to date
      is based on recurrent neural networks.
      In this paper we present a convolutional approach
      to language modeling. We introduce a novel
      gating mechanism that eases gradient propagation
      and which performs better than the LSTM-style
      gating of Oord et al. (2016b) despite being
      simpler. We achieve a new state of the art on
      WikiText-103 as well as a new best single-GPU
      result on the Google Billion Word benchmark.
      In settings where latency is important, our model
      achieves an order of magnitude speed-up compared
      to a recurrent baseline since computation
      can be parallelized over time. To our knowledge,
      this is the first time a non-recurrent approach outperforms
      strong recurrent models on these tasks.

      The prevalent approach to neural machine translation
      relies on bi-directional LSTMs to encode the source sentence.
      In this paper we present a faster and conceptually simpler
      architecture based on a succession of convolutional layers.
      This allows to encode the entire source sentence simultaneously
      compared to recurrent networks for which computation is
      constrained by temporal dependencies.
      We achieve a new state-of-the-art on WMT'16 English-Romanian
      translation and outperform several recently published
      results on the WMT'15 English-German task.
      We also achieve almost the same accuracy as a very deep LSTM setup
      on WMT'14 English-French translation.
      Our convolutional encoder speeds up CPU decoding by more than
      two times at the same or higher accuracy as a strong

      Existing machine translation decoding algorithms generate

      As a result, earlier mistakes cannot be corrected at a later stage.
      In this paper, we present a translation scheme that starts
      from an initial guess and then makes iterative improvements
      that may revisit previous decisions.
      We parameterize our model as a convolutional neural network
      that predicts discrete substitutions to an existing translation
      based on an attention mechanism over both the source sentence
      as well as the current translation output.
      By making less than one modification per sentence,
      we improve the output of a phrase-based translation system
      by up to 0.4 BLEU on WMT15 German-English translation.

      Classical translation models constrain the space of possible outputs
      by selecting a subset of translation rules based on the input sentence.
      Recent work on improving the efficiency of neural translation models
      adopted a similar strategy by restricting the output vocabulary
      to a subset of likely candidates given the source.
      In this paper we experiment with context and embedding-based
      selection methods and extend previous work by examining speed and
      accuracy trade-offs in more detail.
      We show that decoding time on CPUs can be reduced by up to 90% and
      training time by 25% on the WMT15 English-German and
      WMT16 English-Romanian tasks at the same or only negligible
      change in accuracy.
      This brings the time to decode with a state of the art
      neural translation system to just over 140 msec per sentence
      on a single CPU core for English-German.

      To deal with structured data, we allow the model to

      Our neural model significantly outperforms a Templated
      Kneser-Ney language model by nearly 15 BLEU.

      Many natural language processing applications use language

      These models are typically trained to predict the next word

      However, at test time the model is expected to generate the
      entire sequence from scratch.
      This discrepancy makes generation brittle, as errors may
      accumulate along the way.
      We address this issue by proposing a novel sequence level
      training algorithm that directly optimizes the metric used
      at test time, such as BLEU or ROUGE.
      On three different tasks, our approach outperforms several
      strong baselines for greedy generation.
      The method is also competitive when these baselines employ
      beam search, while being several times faster.

      The availability of parallel corpora limits the further success

      Existing approaches that leverage the huge monolingual corpora

      We propose a simple and fast translation model learning method
      that directly hallucinates translation rules for infrequent

      continuous phrasal representations based on widely available
      word vectors.
      We also investigate approximated nearest neighbors query to
      further speed up search for semantically similar neighbors
      in continuous representation space.
      Experiments show that adding translation rules for infrequent phrases
      generated by our algorithm can improve accuracy by up to 1.5 BLEU.
      Compared to existing methods, our approach generates better
      translation rules, and is faster.

    institution: University of Edinburgh
    doc-url: papers/michael.auli.thesis.pdf
    img: thesis2012
    abstract: >
      <p>Parsing is the task of assigning syntactic or semantic structure to a natural language sentence. This thesis focuses on syntactic parsing with Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG; Steedman 2000). CCG allows incremental processing, which is essential for speech recognition and some machine translation models, and it can build semantic structure in tandem with syntactic parsing. Supertagging solves a subset of the parsing task by assigning lexical types to words in a sentence using a sequence model. It has emerged as a way to improve the efficiency of full CCG parsing (Clark and Curran, 2007) by reducing the parser's search space. This has been very successful and it is the central theme of this thesis.

      <p>We begin by an analysis of how efficiency is being traded for accuracy in supertagging. Pruning the search space by supertagging is inherently approximate and to contrast this we include A* in our analysis, a classic exact search technique.Interestingly, we find that combining the two methods improves efficiency but we also demonstrate that excessive pruning by a supertagger significantly lowers the upper bound on accuracy of a CCG parser.

      <p>Inspired by this analysis, we design a single integrated model with both supertagging and parsing features, rather than separating them into distinctmodels chained together in a pipeline. To overcome the resulting complexity, we experiment with both loopy belief propagation and dual decomposition approaches to inference, the first empirical comparison of these algorithms that we are aware of on a structured natural language processing problem.

      <p>Finally, we address training the integrated model. We adopt the idea of optimising directly for a task-specific metric such as is common in other areas like statistical machine translation. We demonstrate how a novel dynamic programming algorithm enables us to optimise for F-measure, our task-specific evaluation metric, and experiment with approximations, which prove to be excellent substitutions.

      <p>Each of the presented methods improves over the state-of-the-art in CCG parsing. Moreover, the improvements are additive, achieving a labelled/unlabelled dependency F-measure on CCGbank of 89.3%/94.0% with gold part-of-speech tags, and 87.2%/92.8% with automatic part-of-speech tags, the best reported results for this task to date. Our techniques are general and we expect them to apply to other parsing problems, including lexicalised tree adjoining grammar and context-free grammar parsing.

      Log-linear parsing models are often trained by optimizing
      likelihood, but we would prefer to optimize for a task-specific metric like F-measure.
      Softmax-margin is a convex objective for such models that minimizes a bound on
      expected risk for a given loss function, but its naïve application requires the loss
      to decompose over the predicted structure, which is not true of F-measure.
      We use softmax-margin to optimize a log-linear CCG parser for a variety of loss functions, and
      demonstrate a novel dynamic programming algorithm that enables us to use it with
      F-measure, leading to substantial gains in accuracy on CCGBank.  When we embed our
      loss-trained parser into a larger model that includes supertagging features
      incorporated via belief propagation, we obtain further improvements and achieve
      a labelled/unlabelled dependency
      F-measure of 89.3%/94.0% on gold part-of-speech tags,
      and 87.2%/92.8% on automatic part-of-speech
      tags, the best reported results for this task.

      Via an oracle experiment, we show that the upper bound on accuracy of a CCG
      parser is significantly lowered when its search space is pruned using a
      supertagger, though the supertagger also prunes many bad parses.  Inspired by
      this analysis, we design a single model with both supertagging and parsing
      features, rather than separating them into distinct models chained together
      in a pipeline.  To overcome the resulting increase in complexity, we
      experiment with both belief propagation and dual decomposition approaches to
      inference, the first empirical comparison of these algorithms that we are
      aware of on a structured natural language processing problem.  On CCGbank we
      achieve a labelled dependency F-measure of 88.8% on gold POS tags, and
      86.7% on automatic part-of-speech tags, the best reported results for this
      task.

      We present a systematic comparison and combination of two orthogonal techniques for efficient
      parsing of Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG).  First we consider adaptive supertagging, a
      widely used approximate search technique that prunes most lexical categories from the parser's
      search space using a separate sequence model.  Next we consider several variants on A*, a
      classic exact search technique which to our knowledge has not been applied to more expressive
      grammar formalisms like CCG.  In addition to standard hardware-independent measures of parser
      effort we also present what we believe is the first evaluation of A* parsing on the more
      realistic but more stringent metric of CPU time.  By itself, A* substantially reduces parser
      effort as measured by the number of edges considered during parsing, but we show that for CCG
      this does not always correspond to improvements in CPU time over a CKY baseline.  Combining A*
      with adaptive supertagging decreases CPU time by 15% for our best model.

    title: CCG-based Models for Statistical Machine Translation
    doc-url: papers/first-year-report.pdf
    img: first-year-report
    abstract: >
      <p>The arguably best performing statistical machine translation systems are based
      on context-free formalisms or weakly equivalent ones. These models usually use
      a synchronous version of a context-free grammar (SCFG) which we argue is too
      rigid for the highly ambiguous task of human language translation. This is
      exacerbated by the fact that the imperfect methods available for aligning
      parallel texts make extracting an efficient grammar very hard. As a result,
      the context-free grammars extracted are usually very large in size after
      having already been restricted through a variety of constraints.

      <p>We propose to use Combinatorial Categorial Grammar (CCG) for machine translation
      models. CCG is a lexicalized, mildly-context-sensitive formalism which
      is very well suited to capture long-distance dependencies that are not
      addressed very well by most current models. We believe that CCG is very well
      suited for the task of machine translation due to its ability to represent
      non-constituents in a syntactic way which frequently occur in parallel texts
      as well as its high derivational flexibility. This allows us to use some of
      the advantages of non-syntactic phrase-based approaches within a syntactic
      framework such as a relatively small grammar size compared to
      context-free-based machine translation grammars.

      <p>A number of models leveraging the advantages of CCG are possible, however, our
      principal goal is to develop a string-to-tree based model which projects CCG
      on the target side of a synchronous grammar. We intend to apply the vast
      progress made in monolingual CCG parsing to machine translation. Additionally,
      we propose to extend CCG to a synchronous grammar (SCCG) as it has been done
      for other related formalisms such as tree adjoining grammars. We hope that a
      SCCG may provide similar derivational flexibility to monolingual CCG which may
      result in a better model for translational equivalence.

      Translation systems are complex, and most metrics do little to pinpoint causes of error or isolate system differences.  We use a simple technique to discover induction errors, which occur when good translations are absent from model search spaces.  Our results show that a common pruning heuristic drastically increases induction error, and also strongly suggest that the search spaces of phrase-based and hierarchical phrase-based models are highly overlapping despite the well known structural differences.
