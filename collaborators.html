    tagline: University of Notre Dame.
    description: >
      David and I worked together on hierarchical translation, an approach
      he invented when when he was a postdoc at the University
      of Maryland and I was a student. I learned much of what I know about
      machine translation just from reading his elegant code.

      from 2008 until 2010, when I joined Johns Hopkins University. 
      In 2014 we switched places: He moved to Johns Hopkins 
      and I returned to Edinburgh. Philipp literally wrote the
      book on statistical machine translation. We worked together
      on several projects.

    description: >
      Philip was my dissertation advisor, and his fingerprints are all over
      my early projects, even the ones that don't have his name on them.
      He taught me much of what I know about research without my even 
      realizing he was doing it.
